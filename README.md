## Obligatory participation

The wednesday timeslot is used for Lab or discussions.

### Lab:
During the lab sessions we work together on small examples that help understand the lecture content. 
If you cannot participate in lab sessions, you have to complete the notebook and show your solution to the lecturer.

### Discussions:
In the discussion sessions we discuss different applications and use cases.
You should prepare for the discussion sessions by doing some reading and research and actively participate in the discussion.
People who do not participate in discussions will have to do a presentation of a use case, based on a review paper, towards the end of the semester.

## Exam info
The exam is an oral exam covering most topics from lectures and discussions.
You have to complete the lab notebooks and either participate in discussion or do a presentation to get to go to the exam.
